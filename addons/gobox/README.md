## Description

The dialog box has a configurable speed and some public variables for use such as history and input_disabled.
You may also want to use the dialog_complete signal which only emits once the user has gone through all dialog inside the box.
When the plugin is enabled you should be able to add it to a scene as a new node.

If you wish to make changes to the style of the box you may modify the DialogRig.tscn file.
